# tests a layer 3 network connection via ping to a designated IP address
# version 1.0-20250302.1/mz
# add to Scheduler with something like: /system/scheduler/add name=ConnTest disabled=yes on-event="/system script run \"connecttest.rsc\"" interval=3

# to-dos:
# issue: Booting RouterOS still causes outage msgs despite checking 'next hop'!
# add: fallback destination IP adress(es) if host/destination IP is offline
# add: include destination IP in log msgs
# change: make DestIP global to be able to change it on the fly w/o altering the script!
# change: "WAN" to "Connection" or so .. make it rather universally descriptive 
# change: write only one line to log if only one packet was dropped
# consider: minimum packet loss before writing to log at all - aka "threshold"
# consider: changing all debug msgs to log to global variables. Would probably need some management.
# consider: writing log msgs to separate log (file?)
# consider: a mode switch which let the script itself run in a loop and won't need a scheduler. Which wouldn't be as accurate.
# consider: better names for local and global variables, esp. for debugging!
# consider: un-setting (removing) nextHopERROR, when next hop is back online
# note: something like this surely exists somewhere already, doesn't it? (if so, consider this an exercise!)
# note: it seems my hAP acÂ³ has no battery for its clock. So upon boot the time remains largely at the one from shutdown.
